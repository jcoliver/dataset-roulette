This is the website for *Dataset Roulette*, an informal opportunity to see how 
data professionals actually deal with, well, data. Working with a dataset that
they've never seen before, a data scientist/engineer/wrangler/enthusiast will
explore, analyze, and visualize data using open source software. We will post 
links to datasets here, and if we can get our act together, recordings of our
attempts to wring meaning from data.
