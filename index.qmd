This is the website for *Dataset Roulette*, an informal opportunity to see how 
data professionals actually deal with, well, data. Working with a dataset that
they've never seen before, a data scientist/engineer/wrangler/enthusiast will
explore, analyze, and visualize data using open source software. Look at the 
[Data & Code](data_code.html) section for links to datasets, code, and
recordings of us trying to wring meaning from data.
